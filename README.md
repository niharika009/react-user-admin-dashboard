# react-user-admin-dashboard
This project is a simple website that helps an administrator manage users. It's built using React, which is a popular way to create interactive websites.



User List: It shows a list of all users in a table.

Add Users: The admin can click a button to add new users by filling out a form.

Edit Users: The admin can click an "Edit" button next to a user's name to change their information.

Delete Users: The admin can click a "Delete" button to remove a user from the list.

Search: The admin can easily find users by typing in their name or email in a search box.

Pages: If there are many users, it shows them in pages (like page 1, page 2, page 3 etc.).

Looks Good: It uses Bootstrap, which makes the website look clean and organized.

Behind the Scenes: It uses Axios to talk to a "server" (another computer program) to save, get, and change user information.
